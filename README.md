# Ami

**The Work Companion Who Truly Knows You.**

Ami watches you work once, learns your methodology, and remembers it forever. Your workflows, your decisions, your shortcuts — encoded into a living memory that grows with you, every single day.

Most AI forgets you the moment the conversation ends. Ami is different — it encodes your methodology, the way you navigate tools, the order you make decisions, the shortcuts only you know — and carries that understanding forward, always.

## How It Works

1. **Work Once** — Just do your work as usual. Ami observes and distills the methodology behind your actions — not just the clicks, but the intent.
2. **Say the Word** — Next time, just describe what you need. Ami retrieves the right methodology from its memory and builds an execution plan.
3. **It's Done** — Ami works the way you would — same decisions, same quality. Review, approve, and reclaim your time for work that matters.

## What Makes Ami Different

- **Encodes Your Methodology** — Not a recording — a deep understanding. Ami extracts the logic behind your actions: why you clicked there, what you checked first, how you decided.
- **Maps Your Work World** — Every tool you use, every platform you navigate, every decision pattern you follow — Ami builds a living knowledge graph of your entire operational landscape.
- **Executes Like You Would** — When Ami automates a task, it doesn't just follow steps — it works the way you work. Same tools, same logic, same quality.
- **Evolves With You** — Change how you work, and Ami adapts. Every execution refines its understanding, discovers better paths, and builds on what it already knows.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + Zustand
- **Desktop Runtime**: Electron 33
- **Backend Daemon**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright (connects to Electron's Chromium via CDP)
- **Memory**: Five-layer cognitive memory system (sensory, working, episodic, semantic, procedural)
